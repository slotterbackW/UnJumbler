# UnJumbler
A command line application for solving the daily Jumble in the San Francisco Chronicle. Written in Python 3.5.

## To Run
Simply navigate to the location of UnJumbler.py in your filesystem and (with Python 3.5 installed and words.txt in the same folder) do
`python UnJumbler.py`

The application will then step you through entering 4 different word jumbles before printing out the final solutions to each Jumble.
Once you've written each solution down, and noted which letters will be used for the final solution, you can use the application to find
possible words for the final solution.

## Example
